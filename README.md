# Design notes
- We agreed to inspect the design not to **copycat** it.
- We agreed that each section will has a `container` to make the content of the whole page starts and ends with same alignment.
- Section names are not changed yet.
- Html files should be in the `root` directory so there is no need to create an `html` folder.
- For the css notes:
    - Use the rules you know but don't copy/paste it without a `fully understanding`.
  
# General Notes
- Always use relative paths in your src/href urls unless its external urls.
- Classes and ids are written in lower-case separated with dashes between each word.
- Don't leave the `href` attribute empty, if you're not going to add any url then set its value to `#` 
    - e.g `href="#"`.
- Always name all sections with a **semantic** word(s).
- Javascript files should be put at the end of the `body` tag.
